  promptDescription: Your advisor is telling you about his awesome new idea, "trickle
    down economics." He says that if you introduce sweeping tax cuts across the upper
    class, that wealth will trickle down through society and reach the working class!
  yesText: Try it out!
  noText: Sounds like a bad idea.
  yesResponse: A bad idea it is. "Trickle down economics" was a real idea proposed
    and attempted by the Reagan administration. 40 years later, the wealth has never
    trickled down.
  noResponse: '"Trickle down economics" was a real idea proposed and attempted by
    the Reagan administration. 40 years later, the wealth has never trickled down.'
