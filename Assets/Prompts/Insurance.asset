  promptDescription: 'A wealthy health insurance CEO has implemented a policy in
    his company that will deny hundreds more claims per day, increasing his own wealth
    and squeezing even more out of the middle and lower class, and is lobbying you
    with lots of money to not pass any restrictions on this.


    Pass a restriction
    despite the lobbying?

'
  yesText: Pass a restriction
  noText: Do not pass any restriction
  yesResponse: The middle and lower classes thank you for protecting them!
  noResponse: The middle and lower class are losing money, and their approval of
    you has dropped. But hey, at least you got some money, and the rich people like
    you more.
