  promptDescription: 'One of your advisors informs you of a situation involving blood
    banks:


    As you may know, it''s legal to sell your blood plasma for some
    quick cash. Currently, the legal limit is twice every seven days. However, the
    blood banks have been consistently lowering their pay rates for a while now,
    leaving many with a dwindling income.


    (PROGRAMMER NOTE: this would be a
    good spot to have more than two options, third would be something like "ban the
    sale of blood plasma all together, only allow donations")'
  yesText: Pass a law creating a fair minimum payout for plasma sellers
  noText: Do nothing
  yesResponse: "This happens in real life. Draining that amount of blood has serious
    adverse health effects, but some people need that additional income to survive.
    These blood collection centers set up in the poorest neighborhoods. The industry
    of paid blood plasma donations was worth $4 billion in 2008, before the global
    financial crisis, and is now expected to reach $48 billion by 2025. \n(PROGRAMMER
